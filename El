Initializing the Project
These Jobs You've Never Heard of

Teacher, Lawyer, Doctor — when someone says “career,” these classic jobs are the first ones you think about, right? 
Yet thousands of career choices exist beyond these basics. From jobs at the bleeding edge of change to jobs so ancient you've probably forgotten what they do, the careers you don't know about probably outweigh the ones you do. And in this age of competition, getting further off the beaten trail can be a good way to differentiate yourself from the pack — with awesome and unusual perks. 
1. Chief Listening Officer
You may not have heard of a Chief Listening Officer, but they've probably heard from you. One rung higher than a social media manager, CLOs closely monitor social platforms and conversations to keep an eye (and ear!) on what's being said about their company or brand. Your work enables a fast response to any and all complaints, issues, or misinformation.
Why it's awesome: This job is extremely new — according to Forbes, the first-ever Chief Listening Officer position was created in 2010. But it's on the rise. As more organizations rely on social media for market research and customer service, the position of CLO will only become more important.
Average salary: $31 000 – $95 000 
2. Computational Linguist
Computational Linguists help computers and humans communicate with each other. More specifically, you create computer programs that can translate, transcribe, and comprehend regular, human language. 
Why it's awesome: This interdisciplinary field is the front line for exciting technological areas like speech recognition and artificial intelligence. In other words, you could help create robots! 
Average salary: $58 000 – $153 000 
3. Global Mobility Consultant 
In the globalizing business world, a whole industry has sprung up around relocating workers from one place to another. As a global mobility consultant, you help employees make smooth transitions into their new homes — whether it's in Bangkok, Berlin, or the next state over. 
Why it's awesome: If you're the type who enjoys travel and likes learning about other cultures' systems and traditions, this career could be a perfect fit. But perhaps the best perk is the job outlook: As companies continue to expand across borders, this position is expected to grow by 21 percent (faster than average) over the next few years. 
Average salary: $29 000 – $93 000 
4. Greensman 
Have you ever noticed Greensman on the film credits role? It's just one of the many movie jobs with baffling titles. Yet the role is fairly straightforward: You're in charge of designing and arranging all the plant materials — both real and fake — on a film set.
Why it's awesome: From alien swamplands to a Jane Austen garden, this job lets you use your artistic skills to create whole new worlds. You couldn't be farther away from a cubicle. 
Average salary: $26 000 – $84 000 
5. Futurist
Futurists are half market researcher and half visionary. In this interdisciplinary career, you examine the present to detect clues to the future. Your predictions about shifting trends help to guide future business decisions. 
Why it's awesome: You're always ahead of the curve — and this applies to the job market too. In fact, you might predict the jobs that will be on a list like this a decade from now — like Global System Architects, Urban Agriculturalists, and 3D Food-Printer Engineer. Sounds wild, but according to futurist Thomas Frey: “As a rule of thumb, 60 percent of the jobs 10 years from now haven't been invented yet.” 
Average salary: $33 000 – $111 000 (566 words)
Section 3%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Text A

 You wouldn't expect it from my childhood: I'd grown up poor in Iowa, and I watched my mother struggle to work full-time and raise six kids on her own, while wishing that Prince Charming would come. 
2 Fast forward a couple of decades, and there I was, living in California and working an executive-level communications and PR job at Nickelodeon, where I'd been for nearly 15 years. I had the financial security that came with my position, including a sizable company pension and a small money market account. I carried my mortgage on a condo as confidently as I carried my Balenciaga bag. 
3 I was a single woman in her late 30's, and on the whole, things were good. As a senior director of corporate communications, I spent the bulk of my time in the office — and the rest running from studios to offices to sets. But my passion for the job was waning. I wasn't miserable, but I wasn't feeling it anymore. And I was watching the company conduct rounds of layoffs during the recession. 
4 I'd always vowed that money wouldn't dictate my happiness, but I was used to stability. Changing career paths would likely mean a pay cut. Without a partner or family to support me — not to mention my mortgage, credit card debt and bills — I was afraid to abandon my executive life. Kind of like how people are afraid to abandon a relationship even when it's no longer working. 
5 The easy thing would have been to set my sights on a similar job in the same field, but I wanted to try something new. Plotting My Great Escape 
6 While still working my corporate job, I started taking classes at a local college to see where my interests lay — and if I could be a student again after being out of school for 15 years. I always loved psychology, so two semesters later, I plunged head-first into a graduate program in clinical psychology at night, while working full-time. The days were long, and I was tired, but I felt alive again! 
7 At work, layoffs were still happening, and I knew that I could be next. I decided if that happened, I'd commit myself to school fulltime. I was actually excited at the possibility! Although my emergency fund would cover me for a few months, I hoped that I'd get a severance package to help with my transition into student-hood. 
8 When I entered my boss's office one summer morning in 2010, I was surprised with the very walking papers that I'd been expecting. Only, instead of celebrating, I panicked! You know that feeling when you're going to break up with someone, but they beat you to it? It was like that — I was prepared, but scared nonetheless. 
9 There I was, free from corporate shackles, but not free from my living expenses, graduate school tuition, credit card debt and a home mortgage. Most of my money was in long-term investments and untouchable without paying severe penalties. At least I had gotten the severance package I hoped for — a safety net to recreate my life. 
10 So I leapt into survival mode, becoming a full-time graduate student at 37 years old. With the assistance of loans, I tackled four classes a semester, so I could complete my degree only a few months after my severance ended. Simultaneously, I pursued PR consulting opportunities to supplement my severance pay and nominal unemployment income. I cut back on luxuries — eating out, manicures and pedicures — and conserved gas whenever possible. Was I Turning Into My Mother? 
11 I'd like to think of myself as an empowered woman, but when I lost my job, my early childhood experiences with poverty triggered a momentary damsel-in-distress moment. I found myself secretly wishing for my own Prince Charming to rescue me. 
12 My stomach churned at the notion that I believed in the same fairytale as my mother once did, but I couldn't help it. Meanwhile, some family members advised me to abandon California for a safer, more affordable life in the Midwest with them. I wasn't opposed to moving to another city if the right opportunity presented itself, but my gut said to stay in California. If I were to move, I wanted it to be for a reason — not to run away. Closing One Door Opens Another (or Two) 
13 A decade earlier, I'd inquired about teaching public relations at the University of Southern California, but the timing hadn't been right. Now, with 15 years of high-profile PR experience, the timing was right. So I began teaching at USC and Pepperdine, while I was still in grad school. 
14 Two months before I received my degree, the non-profit agency where I was training as a psychotherapist offered me a job overseeing their new outpatient and residential drug treatment facilities. It's an amazing organization called Conscious Recovery, which is run by the CLARE Foundation in Santa Monica, California. 
15 The position perfectly married both my careers in strategic communications and psychotherapy. People don't realize how closely related psychology and public relations are — many PR campaigns are rooted in the principles of social psychology. 
16 It's proving to be a fun, enterprising experience — one that corporate America never afforded me. I am now changing the world for the better! The Keys to My Very Own Career Castle 
17 While working at the non-profit agency by day, I searched for an office and networked at night. A little under two years after leaving my PR gig, all of my hard work paid off: I was accepted at a practice that will help me earn my hours working with clients. Jennifer Musselman, M.A., MFTI, proudly hangs above the door of my very own office in Brentwood, Los Angeles. 
18 Today, I am an adjunct professor who directs the development of a rehab facility — while nearing my goal of becoming a fully licensed psychotherapist. In other words, I'm a world away from my corporate job. Now, more than ever, I trust myself and my capabilities. I've also learned that when the going gets tough, I get tougher. 
19 Tackling this challenge at nearly 40 years old was both the most frightening thing I'd ever faced and the most empowering because I did it all on my own! The leap of faith to invest in both my financial future and my personal happiness has made me a stronger, more fulfilled person.
