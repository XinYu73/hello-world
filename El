For all most everyonewe ,we may choose to lie ,when the lie does no obvious harm to others and has some degree of benefits for ourselvs.
A ubiquitous case is when you are having a online exam with a reference just next you and you somehow just have one unsolved question,
if I were you ,it would be hardship to resist the temptation.Another common case happens in gathering with friends,when you don't want to 
get drunk,you may say some advise from a doctor.
The other small lies are called white lies,told to keep the cheated person in a good mode or in a better condition.Such lies happens mostly 
in hosptital.And there is story about "white" lies,a rich father told his son that the family is very poor and lived in village ,only to help
the son to cultivate a frugal and diligent charactors.
In a nutshell,people tell little lies for all kinds if reasons,but always content himself with a seemingly right argument.
